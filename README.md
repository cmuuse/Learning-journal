todays chapter awesome being able to clone and de-clone from git feels like genius
today is a good day!..

day two i created a code block asking the user where he lives and giving three answers
if user answers yes it will prompted the traffic situation in that area, no he will be lucky and finally if user answers different string i will display "you are lucky"
day three was different from day one and two and i learned loops and boolean , and i created my first guess game where i asked the user to guess my favorite number .
